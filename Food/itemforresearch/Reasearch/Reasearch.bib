	abstract = {Objective. To examine relationships involving three extremely high-risk behaviors (drug use, drug trafficking, and weapon carrying) among low-income, urban, African-American early adolescent boys using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
Method. The quantitative phase included 192 African-American boys from 9 through 15 years of age recruited from recreation centers located in low-income communities. Youth completed a survey addressing personal risk practices; intentions to engage in risk practices; risk taking among family, friends and community; and values toward risk practices. They also completed standardized assessments of sensation seeking, perceived peer pressure, and parent-child communication. All questionnaires were self-administered through {MacIntosh} computers programmed to present questions aurally and visually. The qualitative phase included 12 African-American youth from low-income, urban families. The youth participated in 60- to 90-minute interviews regarding drug activities and violence.
Results. Most boys (73\%) were not involved in either drug activities or weapon carrying. Boys who were involved in drug activities or weapon carrying were often involved in other high-risk activities (cigarette and alcohol use, school failure and expulsion) and had low rates of adaptive communication with their parents. The boys reported high rates of drug involvement by their family, friends, and community. However, psychological and interpersonal factors were better predictors of individual risk activities than community or family variables. Personal values regarding economics predicted drug trafficking. More than 56\% of the boys who reported past involvement in drug activities did not anticipate future involvement.
Conclusions. Multilevel strategies are necessary to prevent involvement in drug activities and weapon carrying. Intervention programs should begin early and should promote communication between parents and children, adaptive behavior in school, and avoidance of cigarette and alcohol use. Community-level interventions are needed to alter the myth that drug involvement and weapon carrying are normative and to promote images that are less materialistic and more supportive of education and future-oriented activities.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of systematic research on family influences on the development of drinking patterns of Black and White adolescents. These issues are examined in an ongoing longitudinal study using a representative household sample of 699 adolescents, ages 13 to 16 at Time 1, as well as their parents, in metropolitan Buffalo, New York. Black families were oversampled, yielding data on 210 Black adolescents and their parents. Although Black families have more single-parent households and lower family incomes, Black adolescents have higher abstention rates and lower rates of alcohol abuse and other deviance than White adolescents. The same parenting factors (i.e., support, monitoring, and parent-adolescent communication) are, however, important predictors for both Black and White adolescents. There is evidence that religion is a "protective" factor against alcohol abuse for. Black adolesnts and that White adolescents are more susceptible to peer drinking influences than are Black adolescents.},

	abstract = {Excessive alcohol ingestion disturbs the metabolism of most nutrients. Although alcohol can lead to severe hypoglycemia, alcoholics are usually glucose intolerant, probably due to a inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Ethanol intake also leads to negative nitrogen balance and an increased protein turnover. Alcohol also alters lipid metabolism, causing a profound inhibition of lipolysis. Looking for an association between alcohol intake, nutrition, and alcoholic liver disease, we have observed a higher prevalence of subclinical histologic liver damage among obese alcoholics. Multivariate analysis in a large group of alcoholics has shown that obesity is an independent predictor of alcoholic liver disease. Other authors have reported that alcoholics with a history of obesity have a two to three times higher risk of having alcoholic liver disease than non-obese alcoholics. The possible explanation for this association is that the microsomal system, which plays an important pathogenic role in alcoholic liver disease, is induced in non-alcoholic obese subjects and alcoholics. Also, peripheral blood monocyte cells of obese alcoholics produce higher levels of interleukin-1, a cytokine that can contribute to liver damage. The ingestion of polyunsaturated fatty acids can also increase the damaging effects of alcohol on the liver, as has been demonstrated in rats subjected to continuous intragastric infusion of alcohol. Observations in human alcoholics have shown that liver damage is associated with a higher ratio of C:18:1/C:18:0 and a lower ratio of C:22:4/C:18:2 in liver lipids, consistent with an induction of Δ9 desaturase and an increased peroxidation of C:22:4.},
