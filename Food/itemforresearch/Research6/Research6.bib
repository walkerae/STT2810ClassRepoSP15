	abstract = {In order to investigate the pathogenic mechanism responsible for liver injury associated with chronic alcoholism, we studied the effects of different dietary vitamin E levels in chronically ethanol ({EtOH})-fed rats on the activity and {mRNA} regulation of the manganese superoxide dismutase ({MnSOD}) enzyme. Evidence is accumulating that intermediates of oxygen reduction may in fact be associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease. Since low vitamin E liver content seems to potentiate {EtOH}-linked oxidative stress, we studied the effect of {EtOH} treatment in livers from rats fed a diet deficient or supplemented with vitamin E. Chronic {EtOH} feeding enhanced hepatic consumption of vitamin E in both groups of {EtOH}-treated animals, irrespectively of the vitamin E level of the basal diet and the effect was observed in both the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions. Both {EtOH}-fed groups exhibited increased {MnSOD} gene expression, while the enzyme activity was enhanced only in the vitamin E-deprived group of {EtOH}-treated animals. The significant increase in manganese liver content found only in this last group could explain the rise of enzyme activity. In fact, in the absence of a parallel increase of the prosthetic ion manganese, {MnSOD} {mRNA} induction was not accompanied by a higher enzymatic activity. These findings support the role of oxidative alteration in the {EtOH}-induced chronic hepatotoxicity in which {MnSOD} response might represent a primary defence mechanism against the damaging effect of oxygen radical species.},
